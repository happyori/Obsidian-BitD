- Social

	- Rescue [[Marlane]] from the enemy faction and earn her trust

### Contacts
[[Bryl]] will ask to see [[Patra Bowmore|Pigeon]] since he found a little tip on the new scientist who has been cooking a lot of quality spark and was looking for a distributer. [[Bryl]] will state that he and his gang have over invested and have a large stock already sitting so he is no need of product but it might be useful in the long term.

## Obstacles
- Social
	- [[Marlane]] will be surrounded by a lot of different scientists trying to figure out her secrets and get into her good graces
	- [[Marlane]] does not trust anyone easily and would need a lot of convincing over the durations of the meet
	- There is an Investigator prowling in the group who will be snooping around
	- There will be social awareness clock signifying how aware the people around the crew are about them (and their drug industry). When filled the Investigator and the #Bluecoats will be called
- Assault / Stealth
	- [[Marlane]] was kidnapped by #RedSashes in order to force her into making the product for them
	- The security is pretty high as this will be happening on #RedSashes turf (-1 to engagement)
	- There are 2 levels of the "fortification" meaning that players would need to be extra careful and have to sneak in "twice" (2 clocks for sneaking in). Otherwise a straight Assault would be hard to approach
	- [[Emeline Skora]] will be on the location presenting both an opportunity and an obstacle
### Reward
[[Marlane]] will supply the group with 6 COINS worth of product for free and she will remain an ally and #Contact for #Ashika
