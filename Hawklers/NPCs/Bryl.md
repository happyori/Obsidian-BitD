### Profession
He is a drug dealer for #TheLost

### Traits, Interests, Quirks

Despite his ongoing trouble Bryl is very patient in his approach 
#### Interests
Bryl is also enjoying his time learning of alchemy and medicine and is actively seeking a teacher to help him with this interest and problems
#### Quirk
Bryl is extremely concerned with his appearance and gossip on it. He has been meticulously maintaining the illusion of having lustrous hair which paradoxically put him more on the spotlight of appearance and if something happens and his true hair is exposed he will be extremely ashamed and might even choose an unfortunate way out.
