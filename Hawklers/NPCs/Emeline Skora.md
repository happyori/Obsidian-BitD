# Description


### Looks
Emeline is a striking woman in her 20's. She is from Dagger Islands and after moving to Doskvol shortly joined the #RedSashes as a new comer.
She likes to wear tall boots, with the red sashes uniform (really just a single red sash on her waist) along with a well fitting dress.

### Goals
Emeline is surprisingly almost always on the side of justice, she has a soft spot for civilians and tries her hardest to help them. Her goal is to rise to the top of the #RedSashes and provide some justice where she can.

### Preferred Methods
Emeline understands the power of a good smack and is not against violence to achieve her goals.

### Profession
She is a vendor by profession and during the day stays near the market to both help with the advertisement of the #RedSashes vice but also to see which shops are being popular.

### Traits, Interests, Quirks
#### Trait
She is pretty quite for the character and generally like to speak with her actions rather then words.
```ad-note
collapse: closed
She is quite but she is not timid, if need be she can be loud and its just her preference.
```
#### Interests
She likes to spend some of her slugs every month on fine dining and and overall restaurants, she also frequents bakeries around the #CrowsFoot
#### Quirk
She believes that the Imperium is causing a large amount of the issues in the world and Duskvol for the citizens and is actively seeking people to join in the revolution.
