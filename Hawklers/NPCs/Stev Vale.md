# Description
Stev Vale is a Tycherosi man age of 26. His demonic traits are patches of fish scales with rainbow shine to them. He is ambiguous and concealed man, rarely speaking about himself. He enjoys music (potentially the trait of his possession) and dancing. He is symbiotically possessed by his dead wife's spirit and can be heard talking to "himself"

### Looks
Wild Ambiguous and Concealed Man. He is a Tycherosi with his demonic traits being patches of fish scales and what looks like underdeveloped gills around his neck

He wears heavy medical gloves to hide his hands, along with a "bloodied" apron (in reality the blood is from a pig and he wears it to improve his credibility in Doskvol)

### Goals
His major goal is to cooperate with a powerful entity to find new exciting avenues. He will be more then happy to help those in need.

### Preferred Methods
He prefers to approach any situation with a Teamwork perspective. He loves when any member of the crew helps him around even when he is doing simple things. He will often ask for help to improve the situation and might even attempt to add a few things in the lair with the help of the crew members

### Profession
Doctor. He is one of the few doctors who received full training and is qualified to perform highly skilled surgeries. He is trustworthy with his methods

### Traits, Interests, Quirks
#### Trait
He is arrogant when it comes to medicine, he will argue and be a little snotty when someone mentions anything medicine related

#### Interests
Music, Instruments, Dancing. Stev enjoys a good music and would sometimes practice his musical talents when there is nothing to do in the lair.

#### Quirks
Secretly he is actually possessed by a spirit. Uniquely enough the spirit is that of his wife and they are actually in perfect symbiosis. He will try to hide this fact even though he is loyal to the crew as this is unprecedented and just having more people know of this is extremely dangerous for him.
